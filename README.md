# symbol-picture-maker

Though I'm not the first to make symbol pictures, I prefer to do it my way!
Implementing the opencv, the program can convert pictures to a new matrix of brailles which looks almost the same to the original ones. 

To produce an ideal symbol picture, you still have to try different parameters defined at the begining of the program. According to my experience, this program can't handle low-contrast pictures. But if you are interested and willing to improve the performance of this program, I'll be grateful.

By the way, the symbol-cam program is just a prototype. It accesses your webcam, and continuously converts your picture into symbol pictures. There are still many annoying problems to be solved, like how to clear the console after each display. 

In all, welcome to my first project.

## Requirements:
- Python v3.5.6
- Opencv v3.4.2
